# AGENTS.md

This file is for repository-specific behavior that an agent cannot infer from
the codebase. Keep it short, concrete, and updated when workflows change.

## Core Rules

- Prefer existing codebase patterns over new abstractions.
- Use `rg` or `rg --files` for searches.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Do not revert user or generated changes unless explicitly asked.
- Keep generated test artifacts, platform users, memories, and remote messages
  cleaned up after real-platform tests.

## Runtime Test Hygiene

- Use clearly identifiable test messages, users, and channels.
- Delete Mattermost, Slack, and Signal test messages and bot replies when the
  connector permits it; report any artifacts that remain.
- Mattermost self-hosted counts active and inactive users toward
  `TeamSettings.MaxUsersPerTeam = 50`; delete test users as well as messages.
- Do not leave test-only memories in Blueclaw. Isolate memory tests or run
  `internkim reset blueclaw-history --confirm <deviceID>` after verification.
- Keep people, policy, platform account links, and secrets intact unless the task
  explicitly asks to reset them.

## Web Test Hygiene

- Write Bun unit tests with `test`, `expect`, and `describe` from `bun:test`.
- Do not write top-level assertion scripts in `*.test.ts` files; Bun must report
  real test counts.
- Keep web unit tests under `web/tests/unit/**` and make them runnable through
  `cd web && bun test tests/unit`.
- Add or update a `web/package.json` script when adding a new test category, and
  wire important regression tests into the normal verification path.

## Deployment Hygiene

- After changing Go setup, provisioning, runtime, or service code, run
  `make build` before any `./internkim setup ...` command.
- Use the smallest setup slice that matches the change. Run the same command
  with `--plan` before any non-trivial real-device setup.
- Stop if the plan unexpectedly includes `binaries`, `local-llm`, `llama.cpp`,
  `llama-server`, CUDA, or Jetson model runtime work.
- For Admin/Flow web UI-only changes, use
  `./internkim setup --only admin-web`; add `--force` only when needed.
- For a small `internkim-admind` change, use `make build` and
  `./internkim setup --only admind --force`.
- For a small `internkim-capabilityd` change, use `make build` and
  `./internkim setup --only capabilityd --force`.
- For Blueclaw-only agent-loop, prompt, skill, policy, or schedule/runtime
  logic, inspect a narrow `--plan` first and avoid defaulting to `services` or
  `binaries,services`.
- For uncommitted `.dependency/blueclaw` changes, use
  `INTERNKIM_BLUECLAW_USE_LOCAL=1`. If those changes must enter the Firecracker
  payload, run `make prepare-blueclaw-payload` before setup.
- Avoid `--force-all` unless recovering a broken setup or explicitly asked.
- Do not include `--host`, `--user`, or `--password` when the saved/default target
  works.
- Use targeted checks before full verify suites.

## Blueclaw Terminal Permission Boundary

- Treat Blueclaw policy plus Linux user/group/POSIX permissions as the runtime
  boundary for terminal access.
- Do not make `bwrap` a required v1 boundary; it may be optional narrowing later.
- Project people to `bc_person_<shortID>` users, circles to
  `bc_circle_<circleID>` groups, shared access to `bc_shared`, and service
  internals to `blueclaw`.
- Keep Linux identity names lowercase, limited to `[a-z0-9_-]`, and
  collision-resistant when normalization is lossy or truncated.
- Run raw terminal, terminal sessions, user-authored tools, dependency install
  scripts, and package lifecycle scripts as the requester or task actor's
  unprivileged UID/GID/supplementary groups.
- Admin requesters still use the task actor's least-privilege raw-terminal
  identity. Keep admin-only access and task-scoped grants behind built-in tools.
- Keep `/workspace/.blueclaw/*` service-owned and inaccessible to normal task
  users. Treat `/workspace/private/people/<personID>`,
  `/workspace/circles/<circleID>`, and `/workspace/shared/*` permissions as the
  final workspace access boundary.
- Use `/workspace/shared/cache/dependencies` only for package caches. Never
  place private/source files there.
- Preserve denied executable and denied path guardrails, especially OS package
  managers and system modification commands.
- Built-in tools that read through grants must not leave privileged source files
  in raw-terminal-visible paths.

## Blueclaw LLM-First Runtime Policy

- User-facing answers, failure explanations, approval wording, and recovery
  direction must go through the LLM.
- Deterministic runtime code may validate, normalize, enforce schemas,
  orchestrate retries, and record diagnostics, but must not compose fallback
  sentences for users.
- Exact control acknowledgements for slash commands, such as stop/stop-all, may
  use deterministic system responses; do not expand that exception to task
  judgment, failure explanation, recovery direction, or confirmation wording.
- When a failure requires judgment, request structured output first, then use it
  as input to an LLM-generated user reply.
- If remote and local LLM paths both fail to produce a safe reply, leave task
  events and admin-only diagnostics instead of sending a fixed outage message.

## Companion Runtime Boundary

- Treat `internkim-companion` as the user's local trusted runtime.
- Keep browser cookies, local files, local model paths, and desktop credentials
  on the user's computer.
- Route browser handoff, user confirmation, local file picking, and future local
  model inference through companion capabilities.
- Store only companion signing key references in local state JSON; use OS secure
  storage for keys, with explicit development fallback only.
- Approval grants are task-scoped runtime-memory permissions. Keep
  `user.confirm` and `user.input` outside grant reuse.
- Persist broker jobs under `/root/.internkim/state/companion-jobs.json`; restart
  recovery must not silently drop pending user-local work.
- `file.pick` must hide user-local paths from InternKim and Blueclaw. Upload
  selected files through the signed broker into `/tmp/internkim-companion-files`.
- Browser capabilities must go through a typed browser runtime adapter; do not
  scatter raw `agent-browser`, Playwright, Chrome, or Obscura calls.
- Companion browser support must use the bundled sidecar prepared by
  `make build-companion` or `make deps-companion-browser`.
- Browser observe/screenshot responses must not expose cookies, CDP URLs, local
  profile paths, or local screenshot paths.
- Keep Blueclaw provider-neutral. Blueclaw requests capabilities; InternKim
  chooses device, companion, or remote execution.
- Local-only mode must not fall back to OpenRouter or another remote provider.

## Browser Automation

Browser automation is an interactive fallback, not the default web research
path. Prefer search/fetch tools for ordinary public lookup. Use `agent-browser`
only when the user needs visible browser operation, login/MFA/captcha handoff,
page interaction, page state, screenshots, or when search/fetch fails.

Run `agent-browser --help` for syntax. Core flow: `agent-browser open <url>`,
`agent-browser snapshot -i`, interact with refs such as `@e1`, then snapshot
again.

## Core Principles

1. **Readability is the highest priority** - code should be self-explanatory
2. **Functional style** - prefer pure functions, avoid side effects
3. **Efficiency** - no redundant operations
4. **Simplicity** - minimal code that solves the problem

## Code Style

### No Comments
Code should be self-documenting through descriptive names and small functions.

### No Abbreviations
Use full names: `response` not `res`, `error` not `err`, `configuration` not `config`

### Initialism Casing (camelCase)
- **Leading**: lowercase (`idToken`, `urlParams`, `apiKey`)
- **Trailing**: UPPERCASE (`userID`, `callbackURL`, `oauthAPI`)

### Naming Conventions
- **Functions**: Clear verbs (`calculateTotalPrice`, `validateUserInput`)
- **Variables**: Descriptive nouns (`userAccountBalance`, `authenticationToken`)
- **Booleans**: is/has/can prefixes (`isAuthenticated`, `hasPermission`)

### Function Design
- Each function does ONE thing
- 10-20 lines maximum when possible
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Same level of abstraction within a function

```js
// BAD - mixed abstraction
async function processOrder(order) {
  const user = await database.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${order.userID}`);
  if (!user.isActive) throw new Error('Inactive user');
  await sendEmail(user.email, 'Order confirmed');
  return { success: true };
}

// GOOD - consistent abstraction
async function processOrder(order) {
  const user = await fetchUser(order.userID);
  validateUserIsActive(user);
  await notifyOrderConfirmation(user);
  return createSuccessResponse();
}
```

```js
// BAD - nested conditionals
function processUser(user) {
  if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
      if (user.hasPermission) {
        return doWork(user);
      }
    }
  }
  return null;
}

// GOOD - guard clauses
function processUser(user) {
  if (!user) return null;
  if (!user.isActive) return null;
  if (!user.hasPermission) return null;
  return doWork(user);
}
```

### Functional Style
- Prefer pure functions (same inputs → same outputs)
- Avoid side effects and mutations
- But readability wins over functional purity

```js
// GOOD - functional and readable
const activeUserEmails = users
  .filter(user => user.isActive)
  .map(user => user.email);

// Also GOOD - imperative but clear
const result = {};
for (const item of items) {
  if (item.isValid) {
    result[item.id] = item.value;
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Types
- Define meaningful domain types (User, Order, Product)
- Avoid: `any`, `as` assertions, non-null assertions (!)
- Use `unknown` at boundaries before validation, then narrow to a proper type
- Validate at boundaries, trust internal code

```ts
// BAD
function processData(data: any) {
  return data.map((item: any) => item.value);
}

// GOOD
function processData(data: unknown): string[] {
  const validatedData: DataItem[] = validateAndParseData(data);
  return validatedData.map(item => item.value);
}
```

## Error Handling

**Throw errors only for real errors:**
- External API failures
- Network errors
- Resource exhaustion (not enough credits, disk full)
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Database connection issues

**Be specific and accurate:**
```ts
// BAD - vague
throw new Error('Something went wrong');

// GOOD - specific
throw new Error('Stripe API returned 402: insufficient funds for charge');
```

**Don't wrap everything in try-catch:**
- Only catch errors you expect and can handle
- Let unexpected errors bubble up naturally
- Catching everything hides bugs

```ts
// BAD - catching everything
try {
  const user = await fetchUser(id);
  const orders = await fetchOrders(user.id);
  return processOrders(orders);
} catch (error) {
  return null; // Hides all problems
}

// GOOD - catch specific expected errors
const user = await fetchUser(id);
const orders = await fetchOrders(user.id);
return processOrders(orders);
// Let errors bubble up - they indicate real problems
```

**Handle edge cases without throwing:**
```ts
// BAD - throwing for non-errors
function findUser(users: User[], id: string): User {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === id);
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');
  return user;
}

// GOOD - handle expected cases gracefully
function findUser(users: User[], id: string): User | undefined {
  return users.find(user => user.id === id);
}
```

**Validate at boundaries:**
- Validate user input at entry points
- Validate external API responses
- Trust internal code once validated
